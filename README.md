# git-github-ssh

just run the executable or compile the c code and run the executable or make the shell script as an executable and run.
by running the executable a .ssh directory is created in the home directory and a ssh key value pair is generated stored in .ssh folder.
the public ssh is copied to the clipboard so you just have to paste it
